# hello-world

Hello

I live in Denmark and I'm studying business, but I'd like to get into coding. I'd like to have freelance proficiency in web design aspects, and create my own fun messaging app that has game-like aspects to it and the security/notoriety of blockchain. 

Super

Thanks for reading
